					<h3>CEWS? WTF?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>During the early days of the pandemic, the federal government created the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, or CEWS.</p>
					<p>Effectively, the program provided salary rebates for businesses experiencing pandemic-related revenue drops.</p>
					<p>Cost: Roughly $100-billion.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>But experts said there were some fairly clear design problems with the program.</p>
				</section>

				</section>

				<section>
					<p>There must be stories here, even though the data is awful.</p>
					<p>So…</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Step 1: Get the data.</p>
					<img src="img/scrape.png" alt="">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Step 2: What can we do with this?</p>
					<img src="img/sample.png" alt="">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>A lot!</p>

					<img style="height: 60vh;" src="img/cews-story-3.png" alt="">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>How did we do these stories?</p>
					<p>We combined datasets. Specifically…</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>A copy of the CEWS registry</li>
						<li>Statistics Canada data</li>
						<li>Public company financial statements from SEDAR</li>
						<li>Data from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><strong>Statistics Canada</strong></p>
					<p>Inter-Corporate Ownership database</p>
					<img src="img/statscan.png" alt="">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>This data was then merged by name against the list of CEWS recipients. We took any companies that were public, or wholly-owned subsidiaries (or sub-sub-sub… etc. subsidiaries) of public companies.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><strong>Financial statements</strong></p>
					<p>Then, we manually pulled statements from SEDAR, which were analyzed by a team of four reporters</p>
					<img src="img/tfi.png" style="height: 50vh;" alt="">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p><strong>End result</strong></p>
					<p>A big, messy spreadsheet with findings!</p>
					<img src="img/checking.png" style="height: 75vh;" alt="">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Did a similar thing for bankrupt companies. Found many that took pandemic-relief funds despite having declared bankruptcy before the pandemic happened.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Findings</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Found 388 public companies (or wholly-owned subsidiaries) which received a combined $3.6-billion in CEWS as of early 2021.</li>
						<li>List includes some of the biggest companies in the country: Air Canada, BCE Inc., Canadian National Railway Co., Onex Corp., SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. and Suncor Energy Inc.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Nearly a quarter of the companies receiving CEWS had higher revenue in 2020 vs. 2019. If these companies experienced losses, they were fleeting. This wasn't the stated purpose of CEWS.</li>
						<li>Dozens of companies that declared bankruptcy before the pandemic, with a combined $11-million in debts, took CEWS. Those payments amounted to a direct transfer from the government to creditors.</li>
					</ul>
